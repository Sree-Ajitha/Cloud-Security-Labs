# ☁️ Cloud Security Labs

Hands-on labs for **Google Cloud Associate Cloud Engineer training**, focused on deploying, securing, and automating cloud infrastructure. Labs are structured for **practical experience** in real-world scenarios.

---

## 🧪 Lab Highlights
### Core Labs
- **Compute & Storage:** VM deployment, Cloud Storage buckets, Cloud SQL integration  
- **Networking:** VPC creation, peering, firewall rules, subnet segmentation  
- **Identity & Access:** IAM roles, service accounts, RBAC implementation  
- **Automation & IaC:** Terraform modules, managing infrastructure as code  
- **Security & Monitoring:** VPC security, BeyondCorp Enterprise, Cloud Armor  
- **Scaling & Load Balancing:** HTTP/Internal Load Balancers, autoscaling, Pub/Sub messaging  

> Each lab has an extended write-up in subpart MD files:  
> e.g., `01_Compute_Storage.md`, `02_Networking.md`, `03_IAM_Access.md`, etc.
